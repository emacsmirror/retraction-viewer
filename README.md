# Retraction Viewer

This Emacs package provides a way to show retraction information for citations and citation data at point.
This is done using the [Crossref REST API](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) (experimental version until the feature is available on the regular version).
At the moment, it explicitly supports detection of DOI from [ebib](http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/) as well as `bibtex-mode`.

It is possible show retraction information as a [Universal Sidecar Section](https://git.sr.ht/~swflint/emacs-universal-sidecar), as well as through `eldoc`.

## Configuration

For general use, there is one major variable that must be customized.
`retraction-viewer-crossref-email` should be set to your email address (or an email address that will be checked, see [https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service)).
In particular, it may be helpful to set it to `user-mail-address`, as follows.

```elisp
(setopt retraction-viewer-crossref-email user-mail-address)
```

### Notice Formatting

It is possible to customize how notices are formatted using the `retraction-viewer-notice-format` variable.
The % escapes are defined in `retraction-viewer-format-spec`, which can be customized as well.

The `retraction-viewer-format-spec` is an alist of (unique) characters to either variable names or functions taking a retraction notice message.
In either case, they should return a string, or nil (which will become the empty string).
Retraction notice data is a direct translation from the JSON output of the CrossRef REST API.
As it is at present using the experimental version of the API keys are subject to change.

### Performance Tuning

Additionally, there are two variables which can be used to tune performance: `retraction-viewer-connect-timeout` and `retraction-viewer-timeout`.
These can either be a number of seconds, or nil.
If nil, the variables `plz-connect-timeout` and `plz-timeout`, respectively are used to provide the values.

### Eldoc Configuration

Retraction notices can also be showed using `eldoc`, by enabling both `eldoc-mode` and `retraction-viewer-eldoc-mode`.
Note, this operates asynchronously, and will format notices using `retraction-viewer-notice-format`.
Additionally, collecting retraction data is subject to collecting a DOI (see `retraction-viewer-get-doi-functions` described below).

### DOI getters

Finally, it's possible to configure how the "current DOI" is detected using the `retraction-viewer-get-doi-functions` hook. The functions are evaluated until one returns non-nil.
By default, it will get the DOI from ebib if called in an ebib buffer (`retraction-viewer-get-ebib-doi`), from the bibtex entry-at-point if within a bibtex buffer (`retraction-viewer-get-bibtex-doi`), or if point is on a DOI (see `retraction-viewer-doi-regexp`).
Additional functions can be written to select a current DOI, and should operate by: a) not adjusting match data; b) not adjust point/mark; c) not adjust narrowing, and d) fail early (i.e., return nil ASAP).

## Use as a library

Additionally, `retraction-viewer' is intended to be a way for other packages to get retraction information and related data easily.
To this end, there are three categories of functions it provides: DOI detection, retraction status, and notice formatting.

DOIs can be detected using `retraction-viewer-current-doi` to determine if there is a DOI in the current context (whatever that may be given mode, etc.), for more information about how this can be extended, see above.
Additionally, the `retraction-viewer-doi-at-point` can be used directly to determine if there is a DOI at point (using `retraction-viewer-doi-regexp`).

The retraction status of a DOI can be determined with `retraction-viewer-doi-status`, which will return a list of alists describing any retraction notices found in the RetractionWatch database.
These alists are at present subject to change.
Additionally, a callback, taking the status record can be passed as an optional second argument; for an example of use, see `retraction-viewer-eldoc-function`.

Finally, retraction notices can be formatted easily using a format-string like construct using `retraction-viewer-format-notice`, (see above section, "Notice Formatting" for more information).

## Sidecar Section

Retraction data from `retraction-viewer` may be shown in the [`universal-sidecar`](https://git.sr.ht/~swflint/emacs-universal-sidecar) as follows.

```elisp
(require 'retraction-viewer-section)
(add-to-list 'universal-sidecar-sections 'retraction-viewer-section)
```

There are three main options for configuration.
First is the customizable variable, `retraction-viewer-sidecar-modes` which specifies the modes in which the sidecar is applicable (its default is bibtex mode and ebib-related modes).
Second is the notice format string keyword argument, `:format-string`, which is a format string as described above.
Finally, the bullet character can be modified with the `:prepend-bullet'`argument, which should be a valid org-mode bullet (useful for users of `org-bullets` or `org-superstar`).

## Errors and Patches

If you find an error, or have a patch to improve this package (or are able to add additional DOI getters), please send an email to `~swflint/emacs-utilities@lists.sr.ht`.
